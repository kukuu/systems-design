# Systems Design

The proposed architecture prioritises scalability, security, and performance to handle millions of search and booking requests. The search mechanism leverages ElasticSearch for high-performance filtering, and Redis ensures fast caching to minimise server load on multiple re-current requests. The architecture integrates modern frontend frameworks like React.js and backend APIs with GraphQL, enabling rich interactions and seamless user experiences. Monitoring tools such as Prometheus and ELK provide reliability and observability for the system in production.
